# CS 111
Welcome to the course repository page for CS 111.  In the [course resources](https://github.com/acarteas/Teaching-CSFoundations1/tree/master/course%20resources) 
folder you'll find the course syllabus, calendar, and textbooks. 

## Software
In this class, we'll be learning to program using both JavaScript and C++.  While you are
free to use whatever software you'd like to program, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
for JavaScript programming and Visual Studio 2017 for C++ programming.  Visual Studio 2017
[Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) is free for everyone and Visual Studio 2017
[Enterprise Edition](http://humboldt.onthehub.com/) is free for HSU computer science majors (login required).
 Either will work just fine for our class.
