# CS 111
Welcome to the course repository page for CS 111.  In the [course resources](https://github.com/acarteas/Teaching-CSFoundations1/tree/master/course%20resources) 
folder you'll find the course syllabus, calendar, and textbooks. 

## Software
In this class, we'll be learning to program using both JavaScript and C++.  While you are
free to use whatever software you'd like to program, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
for JavaScript programming and Visual Studio 2017 for C++ programming.  Visual Studio 2017
[Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) is free for everyone and Visual Studio 2017
[Enterprise Edition](http://humboldt.onthehub.com/) is free for HSU computer science majors (login required).
 Either will work just fine for our class. 

 While Visual Stuido Code is available on all major platforms, Visual Studio 2017 is only available on Windows.
 If you're running MacOS or Linux, you'll have to use another software package.  Visual Studio Code can
 be [configured to compile and debug C++ applications](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp), but the
 setup is a bit cumbersome.  For MacOS, you can use Apple's Xcode or JetBrain's CLion.  For Linux, I would suggest
 using NetBeans.  

 ## Grades
 Course grades will be published on [Canvas](https://canvas.humboldt.edu).
