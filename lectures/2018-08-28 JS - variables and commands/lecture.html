    Variable types
    Javascript has six variable types:
        numbers (whole and decimal)
        strings (text)
        boolean (true / false)
        null (nothing)
        undefined (similar to nothing)
        function
        object (complex entity)
    */
    var x = 123.456; //JS remembers to interpret X as a number
    var y = "Hello, World!"; //JS remembers to interpret Y as a string
    var z = true; //Boolean value
    var a = null;
    var b = undefined;
    var c = alert; //this is a function

    //test variable types
    /*
    alert("x: " + typeof(x));
    alert("y: " + typeof(y));
    alert("z: " + typeof(z));
    alert("a: " + typeof(a));
    alert("b: " + typeof(b));
    alert("c: " + typeof(c));
    x = "test";
    alert("x: " + typeof(x));

    //Operations: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
    //The result of the operation changes based on the
    //variable type that we are operating on.
    x = 5;
    y = 3;

    //this will mathematically add x and y (8)
    //alert(x + y);

    //this will combine the strings (53)
    x = 5;
    y = "3";
    //alert(x + y);

    //Whenever you're operating on two variables, it's best to be certain
    //that you know what will happen.  Thus, we need to often
    //convert between variable types.

    //to convert from string to number
    y = Number(y);
    //alert(x + y);

    //to convert from a number to a string
    x = "" + x; //adding an empty string to a number to force string conversion
    //alert(typeof(x));

    //question: what happens if we try to multiply two strings
    //alert("Hello" * "World");

    //example of % (mod)
    //% gives us the remainder of division.  This says what is the remainder
    //of 11 / 4
    alert(11 % 4);

    //example of ++
    x = 5;
    x = x + 1;
    x++; //this does the same as above
    alert(x);

    //example of --
    x--;
