    //In class yesterday, we wrote the assignment
    //command like:
    //LET x = 5

    //In JavaScript, this is written like:
    var x = 5; //the semi-colon is like a period in a sentence

    //Bad practice below:
    //var y = 2; var z = 7;

    //Ideally, we want no more than one command (sentence) 
    //per line.
    y = 2;
    z = 7;

    //show the words "Hello, World!" on the screen
    //alert("Hello, World!");

    //output the computation of x and y
    //alert(x + y);

    //get 2 numbers from the user, display the product
    //of those numbers with a helpful message
    result = prompt("Enter a number: ");
    other_result = prompt("Enter another number: ");

    //result is "5" which is not the same as the number 5
    //"5" is a string!
    //alert(typeof(result));

    //Thus, we must convert our inputs into numbers
    result = Number(result);
    other_result = Number(other_result);

    total = result + other_result;

    //give back to user
    alert("The product is: " + total);
